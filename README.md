# Task for Verenia

*The task is to create a textured floor with the 3 textured walls, put inside the room any object. It must be draggable and stay inside the room where it has 3 walls. The object collides with the room walls when dragging it. The object can go outside the room where it has no wall; Once camera rotated, need to make the walls transparent/hidden for spectator*

I know that there are several ways to check collisions of meshes in Babylon, I tried to use physical engines, but they worked strangely with objects which have drag-and-drop behavior. So I use over way.
